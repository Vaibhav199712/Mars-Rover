This project is a simulation of a Mars-Rover bot. Here we have a (N*M) Grid with certain position blocked. We also have a bot with its intinial coordinates and which can move one step ahead, turn left, turn right. When the user ends the simulation we display the final coordinates of the bots journey. 
The java executable file which contains the main method is Simulation.java.
